# duplicate_question_pair
Quora and Stack Exchange are knowledge-sharing platforms where people can ask questions in the hopes of attracting high-quality answers. Often, questions that people submit have previously been asked. Companies like Quora can improve user experience by identifying these duplicate entries. This would enable users to find questions that have already been answered and prevent community members from answering the same question multiple times. Consider the following pair of questions: Is talent nurture or nature? Are people talented by birth or can it be developed? These are duplicates; they are worded differently, but they have the same intent. This blog post focuses on solving the problem of duplicate question identification.
